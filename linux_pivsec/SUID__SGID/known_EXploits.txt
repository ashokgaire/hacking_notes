====== known EXploits ======
Created Tuesday 19 May 2020

Find all the SUID/SGID executables on the Debian VM:

find / -type f -a \( -perm -u+s -o -perm -g+s \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2> /dev/null

Note that /usr/sbin/exim-4.84-3 appears in the results. Exploit-DB, Google, and GitHub are good places to search!

A local privilege escalation exploit matching this version of exim exactly should be available. A copy can be found on the Debian VM at /home/user/tools/suid/exim/cve-2016-1531.sh.

Run the exploit script to gain a root shell:

/home/user/tools/suid/exim/cve-2016-1531.sh
